Google has long been championing this practice, pushing their own solution, Google Website Optimizer.\n<!--more-->\nThe market is evolving and different solutions begin to surface. In order for such tools to meet their goals, there are a couple of key elements that must be considered:\n<ul>\n\t<li>ease of implementation: preparing your site for a/b testing must be a straightforward and timely process, both in the first setup phase, and while creating new experiments</li>\n\t<li>clear, easy to understand, real time reporting</li>\n</ul>\nAfter trying GWO I was quite disappointed: even the simplest test required integrating multiple blocks of JavaScript, in the experiment page and in the conversion page. If you want to get the best from a/b testing you have to fail fast: timing is key.\n\nNow, enterÂ <a href=\"http://www.optimizely.com/\">Optimizely</a>: one file deploy, WYSIWYG editor, Google Analytics integration, easy reporting with multiple on-the-fly goals for each experiment. At an affordable pricing.\n\nTry it out for yourself: first month is free and wow reactions guaranteed when you'll show it to your coworkers.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1506}]],"length":1506}
