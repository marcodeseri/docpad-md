How do you streamline the digital optimization process? Is there an established method? What are the steps? I asked myself those questions many times and came to formulate some tentative answers. Here is my take at data informed <strong>web optimization in ten steps</strong>.

<h3><a id="goals" name="goals"></a>1. Define your goals</h3>
The key to successful optimization is defining specific goals. Most of the time they will be strictly related to your company <strong>activities and targets</strong>: if that is not the case, think twice, you could be focusing on something that is not that strategic. If you have a clear goal, think about what kpis are the most relevant to measure how you are doing.

Before starting your optimization efforts, identify the metrics you will be monitoring with your web analytics and business intelligence tools. Most of the times you will be dealing with conversion rate, registration rate, average order value.

Sometimes you will work on secondary goals, like improving the rate at which users advance from the category listing to the product page: if you set such specific goals, <strong>don't forget the big picture</strong>. Define control indicators and be sure to verify your changes don't hurt them.
<h3><a id="tagging" name="tagging"></a>2. Review your analytics implementation</h3>
Web analytics services are incredibly powerful tools in the hand of the digital optimizer. However, they can be very misleading if the site has flaws in its tagging.

It is important you review your code implementation and verify the kpis you will be using are properly recorded. <strong>Don't start optimizing until you trust your data</strong>: this will save you time and frustration later on. Some great tools for checking your analytics implementation are <a href="http://www.rosssimpson.com/dev/omnibug.html">Omnibug Firefox Extension</a> and <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a>. Companies with higher budget would look for enterprise solutions like <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/products/online_analytics/digitalpulse">Adobe Digital Pulse</a>.
<h3><a id="alerts" name="alerts"></a>3. Setup your reports and alerts</h3>
Web analytics tools are great at showing where your site fails: they provide insightful reports to analyze landing page performance, understand which steps in a funnel are the least effective, monitor bounce and exit rates. In a data driven organization, Web Analytics represents the starting point of the web optimization lifecycle.

Every analytics package will let you configure alerts. If you use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a>, you will also have access to an incredibly useful intelligence area, with powerful automated and custom alerts (remember they are not real-time: you will receive them a couple of days after the events happened).

You can leverage some basic maths to analyze your trends and calculate standard deviation, min and max: they will be useful in configuring thresholds for your alerts. On Cardinal Path, you can find an interesting read about <a href="http://www.cardinalpath.com/blog/the-math-behind-web-analytics-mean-trend-min-max-standard-deviation">maths and web analytics</a>. Alerts will come handy later on, maybe months after you set them up initially.
<h3><a id="benchmarks" name="benchmarks"></a>4. Identify relevant benchmarks</h3>
A deep <strong>understanding of your context is key</strong>: reports and alerts are only effective if they consider seasonal peaks, specific promotions and commercial activities that other departments have been running. Even more important are benchmarks from other sites in your industry: knowing <strong>how other players perform on specific kpis</strong> will help you get started and set appropriate targets. Comparing your kpis against relevant benchmarks can help you identify problems and focus on the most critical paths.

<a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/t">Internet Retailer</a>Â is a great starting point, with lots of data available both online and through their printed guides. Other online resources for competitive intelligence data are <a href="http://www.alexa.com">Alexa</a> and <a href="http://www.hitwise.com">Hitwise</a>.
<h3><a id="analyze" name="analyze"></a>5. Analyze</h3>
Now that you have your own trusted data and relevant benchmarks, it's easier to focus on the single area of your site that shows the most room for improvement. <strong>Give higher priority to actionable pages</strong>.

Use analytics data to understand what traffic segments are underperforming: this could help you spot localization issues, low quality acquisition campaigns, technical problems on a specific browser. Even if you are confident your site is thoroughly tested, this kind of things can mine your conversion rate. Again, don't rush to the next step until you got the basics covered.
<h3><a id="problem" name="problem"></a>6. Understand the problem</h3>
Even when you know where the problem is, there can be different causes for an underperforming section of your site. Before trying multiple combinations of elements through multivariate testing, you should focus and <strong>understand what your customers miss</strong>.

<strong>Usability tests</strong> are great at this stage. If you don't have enough budget, you can run Guerilla tests or use softwares like <a href="http://www.clicktale.com">Clicktale</a> to better understand how users navigate the site and possibly why they behave like that. One of the great features Clicktale has to offer in the Enterprise Edition is the ability to create funnels and identify customers who left at a specific step, receive alerts on that and see their navigation session. It also points out which customers and pages originated JavaScript errors.
<h3><a id="hypothesis" name="hypothesis"></a>7. Formulate hypothesis</h3>
It's time to take action: mockup your changes - tools like <a href="http://www.axure.com">Axure</a> and Balsamiq <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com">Mockups</a> will help you out in this phase - and refine your designs. For small tweaks, sometimes you will go straight to your code: in those cases remember to at least screenshot all the variations you are going to test live.
<h3><a id="test" name="test"></a>8. Field test your hypothesis</h3>
Implement your changes with your preferred tool (<a href="http://www.optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> and <a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/">Visual Website Optimizer</a> are great and affordable products).

Measure the goals you set in the first place. Don't just stop at the data the a/b testing tool will provide you with. Dig deeper and l<strong>everage the integration of those tools with your web analytics package</strong>. This way you will be able to <strong>verify other control indicators</strong>.

Maybe you are increasing the conversion rate, but lowering the average order value. Never forget the big picture and the ultimate reason why you have made those changes.
<h3><a id="document" name="document"></a>9. Document your work</h3>
Some of the tests you perform won't end up with the results you expected. <strong>Documenting is as important as testing in the first place</strong>, because you and your team can learn from your previous tests. When documenting a test, report on key info: hypotesis behind the test, screenshots of all variations, tested users, observed results. Always note if the test was run only on portions of your audience, by explaining what segment received what content.
<h3><a id="again" name="again"></a>10. Start again</h3>
Time to go back to number 5...
