Balsamiq Mockups is a great tool for wireframing, and much more than that: it's the only place where Comic Sans actually looks good.

With Balsamiq you can create sketchy-styled wireframes, that don't distract your stakeholders from what is important at this stage.

Assuming you have flash, Balsamiq works both on your desktop and as a web application (some restrictions still apply to the web version), giving you a cross platform environment to style your next big hit.

Its drag and drop interface, together with its rich library and fast editing, will make you fall in love at first sight.

Just pick an interface element and drag it on the stage; then edit the content to fit your needs. You can group assets to speed up the creation of multi page wireframes.

Overall, it's a great tool and it already offers some mobile components as well.
