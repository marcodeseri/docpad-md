<p style="display: inline !important;">The <strong>mobile space is growing fast</strong>: mobile devices are convenient, affordable and so user friendly a 2 years old can use them. When native apps came, they enabled people to discover new services and have fun in the process. They grow so quickly they became one of the reason people chooses a specific device over another.</p>

Today, 40% of all tweets come from mobile devices.

Still, twitter native app users get frustrated often, when trying to follow someone new after reading an article. And it's just a part of a broader problem: <strong>native apps don't get the web right</strong>.

<!--break-->An image is worth a thousands words:

<img style="width: 440px; height: 330px;" alt="You need to be signed in to do that!" src="/images/content/twitter-native-loggedout.jpg" />

<strong>Oh No! You need to be signed in to do that!</strong>

But, wait...I'm supposed to be signed in, I'm in the Twitter App!

This is quite common, and I bet you are very familiar with the steps that led me there:
<ul>
	<li>you tap on a link from your timeline</li>
	<li>you find the article interesting, and spot the <em>follow on twitter</em> link</li>
	<li>you tap it and... you need to be signed in to do that</li>
</ul>
No mystery on why this happens: the twitter mobile app displays web content in a browser, and that browser needs to authenticate in order to perform the action you requested.

Even if you are logged in, you will eventually end up seeing a twitter for mobile timeline framed in your native app. And it feels awkward every time it happens.

There is no easy way around this: the <strong>web and native app spaces were set apart since the very beginning</strong>. This is not a Twitter exclusive. It happens all the time.

Say you have the LinkedIn app installed on your mobile. Someone invites you to connect: you get an email, with a well designed button that just says 'accept invitation'. You tap it and... you end up on teaser page that invites you to download the LinkedIn App for your iPad. The same app you already installed and signed into.
<h3>Stay with the Web</h3>
Developing your mobile service as a <b>web app is wiser</b>: you are going to support a greater number of platforms and devices out of the box, and your users are going to suffer less frustration along the way.

Many javascript libraries offer native-like environments, rich and enjoyable (I love <a href="http://www.sencha.com">sencha</a>, but there is plenty of choice). If you don't need to access hardware on the device, a web app is probably a better choice. Do you think an App Store will give you better visibility? Maybe. But with other 300,000 apps fighting for attention, that visibility would not last long.
