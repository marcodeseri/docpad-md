The most important aspect of this report is that it shows actual page performance, as experienced by your users (unlike most web performance measuring tools that rely upon custom agents, on a limited set of geographic locations).

All you need to set it up is this single line of code:

<code>_gaq.push([‘_trackPageLoadTime’]);</code>

The report is only available in the new version of Google Analytics, now released to everyone.
