A/B testing tools are getting an ever growing attention lately: all the big guys are using increasingly sophisticated systems to test their designs and measure the effectiveness of each variation. Google has long been championing this practice, pushing their own solution, Google Website Optimizer.

The market is evolving and different solutions begin to surface. In order for such tools to meet their goals, there are a couple of key elements that must be considered:
<ul>
	<li>ease of implementation: preparing your site for a/b testing must be a straightforward and timely process, both in the first setup phase, and while creating new experiments</li>
	<li>clear, easy to understand, real time reporting</li>
</ul>
After trying GWO I was quite disappointed: even the simplest test required integrating multiple blocks of JavaScript, in the experiment page and in the conversion page. If you want to get the best from a/b testing you have to fail fast: timing is key.

Now, enterÂ <a href="http://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>: one file deploy, WYSIWYG editor, Google Analytics integration, easy reporting with multiple on-the-fly goals for each experiment. At an affordable pricing.

Try it out for yourself: first month is free and wow reactions guaranteed when you'll show it to your coworkers.
